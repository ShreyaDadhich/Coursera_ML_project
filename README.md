# The Best Classifier
## Problem Statement
We have been given a historical dataset of Bank Customers applying for loan and we have to predict whether a new customer will be able to pay the loan on time or not. It is a typical classification problem, here we can apply different machine learning models to predict the final outcome and then we have to choose which among these models and algorithms is best for the given problem.
